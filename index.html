  <div class="desc">Aerial silks were invented in 1995 by André Simard. 
	He was hired by Cirque du Soleil to develop and research acrobatics in 1987; 
	his job was to discover original and imaginative ways to attract audiences. 
    Now silks have been incorporated into the circus arts and are practiced as a form of aerial fitness.
